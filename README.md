## Introduction

At the onset of our preparations for the competition, we embarked on extensive research to explore various options related to the design, programming, and algorithms for our self-driving car. After thorough investigation and analysis, we formulated a comprehensive plan to guide our development process. 




## Mechanical Desigen

At the forefront of our self-driving car project, we embarked on the mechanical design phase with a clear vision in mind: to create a robust and efficient vehicle that would excel in autonomous navigation. This phase marked a crucial step in translating our conceptual ideas into a tangible, functional reality.

As we delved into the mechanical design process, we were presented with a critical decision: to either procure a pre-built car or embark on the ambitious task of designing and manufacturing our own vehicle. After careful consideration and evaluation of the project's scope and requirements, we opted to take on the challenge of designing and printing our own car.

After completing the initial prototype and installing the necessary components in the car, we encountered numerous challenges across different areas, such as sourcing suitable sensors, dealing with power supply issues, and overall inefficiency. As a result, we made the strategic decision to transition to an open-source design utilizing aluminum extrusion.
This move offers several advantages, most notably access to a vibrant and supportive community of 
developers.https://github.com/h0z1a1/Team_Hope_WRO/blob/813c5d2b3da322c21aa2c08c1a3def9fc738b66c/v-photos/Down.jpeg
